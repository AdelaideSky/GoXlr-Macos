#  GoXlr for Mac
### Macos app for managing GoXlr without any VM

For now, full control & compatibility is not possible on mac, you still need a windows vm if you want to update colors, mic & effects but - unlike what TC-helicon said, the device is perfectly compatible with Macos and this app shows it.

Oh also, I have absolutely no link with TC-Helicon, i'm not affiliated with them and this project too. The official driver is on their website and it's not their responsability if there is any damage to your device (GoXlr/GoXlr mini)

## Warning

This project is at an really early state, and is not really ready for use. I'm working on a solution to make it easier to install, use and add more capabilities. So if you're not friendly with the terminal and with command lines, this project isn't for you for now.
