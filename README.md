### SwiftUI application to manage the GoXLR on MacOS.


</div>
&nbsp


>There is currently no official support for the GoXLR on MacOS provided by TC-Helicon,
>however the GoXLR is compatible as a basic audio device. This project aims to bring
>unofficial support for all the GoXLRs features to MacOS.


**Disclaimer:** I have absolutely no link with TC-Helicon.
I'm not affiliated with them and neither is this project.
The official driver is available on their website and any damage caused to
your device is your responsibility.

## Set up

- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Adelenade/GoXlr-Macos/releases).
- Open the .pkg file and follow the instructions to install the app on your computer.
- If your GoXLR is plugged in, unplug it and plug it in again.
- Wait a few seconds before launching the app. Be sure to check your menubar, as it's a menubar based app !
- **If the app crashes**:
  - Run the command `killall goxlr-daemon` in your terminal.
  - Wait a few seconds before restarting the app.
- Follow the app's setup flow !
- Enjoy!

## Notice

- The GoXLR can be initialized without being rebooted each time it shuts down.
- The app provides only a alternative UI more integrated within the system for the GoXLR-Utility, as well as audio support and plug-and-play.

## Support

If you have any problem using your app and don't feel confident using github issues, you can go to this support server to ask for help !

## To-do list

- Live-UI (like windows behaviour in mixer tab)
- Full audio support with Audio-server plug-in.
- Add other features of the GoXLR (colours, sampler...)

- Many more...

## Credits

- A lot of love to the devs of the 
[GoXLR-Utility](https://github.com/GoXLR-on-Linux/GoXLR-Utility)! 
Without this project, the development of this application would not
have been possible.
